Combining plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Have two plots that you would like to see displayed together, maybe as an animation or subplots? You've come
to the right place!

Do it yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't like the plots that we, with all the love of the world, have prepared? 

That seems unlikely, but if it happens, you can easily create your own plots! The following notebooks will guide you through 
the process and by the end of your reading it will be dead easy for you to have a **self-updating plot that can be used and tuned in the GUI**.

    Consider contributing to the package if you build a useful presentation. The community will appreciate it! :)
